> ### Bindings
> Currently there is WIP Odin binding where the library compiles down to a static library that Odin links to. However, you are free to use the [master-staticlib](https://www.github.com/KamilKrauze/Socked/tree/master-staticlib)

## Why use it?
Currently the C/C++ standard library doesn't have its own portable standard implementation for network socket programming.
While there are other more popular libraries that do achieve this, I figured that I should create my own to learn socket programming.
